## What I do

- **AI architecture & engineering** – designing data and AI platforms, services and workflows that are secure, observable and maintainable.
- **Secure AI & data products** – building and integrating AI systems that respect safety, privacy and regulatory constraints.
- **Business analytics & optimisation** – turning operational data into decisions for healthcare, energy and other complex environments.
- **End-to-end delivery** – from discovery and solution architecture through to implementation, deployment, monitoring and iteration.

I work at the intersection of **data science, cyber security and digital engineering**, helping organisations connect the right cognitive technologies to their highest-value opportunities.

## Current focus

- 🛡️ **Secure & responsible AI** – threat-aware designs, governance and risk-based controls across the AI lifecycle.  
- 🧱 **Production-grade Python & services** – FastAPI, testing, dependency management with `uv`, and modern project structures.  
- 🏥 **Healthcare operations analytics** – demand, capacity and no-show modelling to improve access and efficiency.  
- ⚡ **Energy & climate data** – methane emissions, monitoring and operational insights across critical infrastructure.

## Selected projects

### 🛡️ Cyber security & reliability

- [`msc_cybersecurity_project`](https://github.com/Chukwuedo/msc_cybersecurity_project)  
  End-to-end MSc cyber security project structured like a real-world Python service (`src/`, `tests/`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`) with data, notebooks and automated tests.

- [`log-monitoring-application`](https://github.com/Chukwuedo/log-monitoring-application)  
  FastAPI application that parses log files, calculates job durations, applies configurable warning and error thresholds and exposes a simple API, backed by tests and modern Python tooling.

### 🌍 Energy, climate & critical infrastructure

- [`methane-minder`](https://github.com/Chukwuedo/methane-minder)  
  Groundwork for methane emissions analysis using Carbon Mapper data – data dictionaries and structures for plume-level attributes (location, instrument, IPCC sector, emission estimates and uncertainty).

### 🏥 Healthcare & social impact

- [`patient-appointment-noshow-analyses`](https://github.com/Chukwuedo/patient-appointment-noshow-analyses)  
  Analyses of medical appointments in Brazil to understand and model drivers of patient no-shows.

- [`endsars-twitter-analyses`](https://github.com/Chukwuedo/endsars-twitter-analyses)  
  Twitter analysis around the #EndSARS movement, combining data work with social impact.

*(You will also find earlier projects including password generators, COVID-19 impact estimates and coursework from my Digital for Industries programme.)*

## How I think

I am motivated by **self-discipline, integrity, diligence and respect for others**. I care about:

- Building **ethical, secure and data-driven organisations**  
- Connecting **strategy, technology and operations** in a language executives and engineers both understand  
- Delivering **pragmatic, production-ready solutions** rather than theoretical models that never leave a notebook  

---

## Beyond code

Outside work I invest in deepening my skills in:

- **AI and data architecture**  
- **Cyber security and secure-by-design principles**  
- **Digital engineering, cloud & edge computing, and the internet of things**

All with the aim of becoming a more effective, ethical technical leader for data and AI in critical environments.
